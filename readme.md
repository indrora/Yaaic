 [![F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/wiki/images/0/0f/F-Droid-button_smaller.png)](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=indrora.atomic) (Coming soon to the Android and Amazon app markets!)

Atomic - a Fork of Yaaic
========================

Atomic scratches an itch I (@indrora) had: A sexy IRC client that worked.
After trying HoloIRC, AndChat, yaaic, and several others, yaaic came the
closest and after pressure from friends, I decided to go ahead and
fork yaaic.

Atomic's official IRC channel is `#atomic-irc` on Freenode.

I'm changing the name to prevent clashes with yaaic, and to preserve
Sebastian's honour. 

The last bit of the original yaaic readme is kept below;

Newer icons used within are from the Android core icon pack, from Google.
Ostensibly, they are (C) Google, inc. They are provided free of charge
to Android developers. I claim no exclusive usage of them other than to say
I use them.

The application icon is derived from the CC-BA 3.0 Unported icon by Designmodo. Its details can be seen at Iconfinder:

* https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/115722/chemistry_lab_science_test_vials_icon#size=512

Things that I have changed/added
================================

* Icons now match the Holo style (predominantly)
* Highlight notification sound can be chosen from the settings

Many of the translations are in flux. Please [contribute on Crowdin](http://www.crowdin.net/project/atomic) to make sure
your language is spoken by Atomic!


Current/future features/changes
===============================

* Option to not hide the soft keyboard on SEND (Somewhat DONE!)
* Changing the size of the font in dp not in px (Working on it!)
* Update of all the icons (DONE!)
* Selecting a message copies it to the clipboard (There's support in there somewhere)
* Option to not scroll when a new message appears in a channel (Kinda done!)

Building Atomic
===============

Atomic is built on Gradle. You should be fine.

Working on Atomic
